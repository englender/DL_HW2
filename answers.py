part2_q2 = r"""
**Your answer: When training a model with the cross-entropy loss function, it is possible for the test loss to increase
for a few epochs while the test accuracy increases also.
This can be explained by the following scenario: examples with a small margin error that are predicted wrong can be
changed slightly and make the prediction correct, thus the accuracy increases. Simultaneously, two other things can 
happen that increase the loss while the accuracy increases as explained above. Examples with a big margin error that are
predicted wrong can increase their margin error thus the loss increases. Also, examples with very good predictions (by
a big margin) can get a little worse but still be predicted correctly, also affecting the loss and increasing it. When 
all these events happen we can see the above scenario happen.
